### TinyEngine

A very small 2D Game Engine which helps you learn how to make games.

### Why did i do this?

I was trying to find a fully implemented Python game engine, but I couldn't,
so I decided to build one.

### Documentation

For now the engine is in early development state, so any further documentation
will be written when there's a stable build.
