A very small 2D Game Engine which helps you learn how to make games.

### Why did i do this?

I was trying to find a fully implemented Python game engine, but I couldn't,
so I decided to build one.

### Documentation

For now the engine is in early development state, so any further documentation
will be written when there's a stable build.

### Starting your game

Currently, your game must reside inside `script` folder and all your arts must be in `arts`.
To run your game, use `python3 manage.py run`. A virtual environment is HIGHLY advised.
We are not responsible for anything breaking on your end, this engine is still in it's early stages as we said above.
