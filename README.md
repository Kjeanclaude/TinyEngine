### TinyEngine
A very small 2D Game Engine which help you to make and learn how to make games.

### Why did i do this?
I was trying to find a full implemented Python game engine, but i couldn't, so i decided to build one.

### Documentation
For now the engine is in development state, so any further documentation will be written when there is a usable build.
